				<h1>Arthur Morgan</h1>
				<p><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></p>
				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Morgan_(Red_Dead)">Arthur Morgan</a> is a fictional character and the protagonist of the 2018 video game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. A high-ranking member of the Van der Linde gang, Arthur must deal with the decline of the Wild West while attempting to survive against government forces and other adversaries in a fictionalized representation of the American frontier. He is portrayed by Roger Clark through performance capture.</p>
				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Games">Rockstar Games</a> decided to focus Red Dead Redemption 2 on one character, in order to follow him more personally. They felt that this was more appropriate for the narrative structure of a Western. Clark wanted to play Arthur in a manner that was complex enough for the player to choose his path and still make sense. He took inspiration from actors such as Toshiro Mifune, John Wayne, and Rob Wiethoff, who played John Marston in the game and its predecessor.</p>

	<h3>Fictional character biography</h3>
	<p>Arthur Morgan joined Dutch van der Linde's gang when he was fourteen, having lost his parents at a young age, and soon became Dutch's first protégé. Arthur had a son, Isaac, with a waitress named Eliza; he demonstrated regular support for them until they were killed by robbers. Over time, Arthur transformed into Dutch's most dedicated enforcer.</p>
	<p>When an unsuccessful ferry heist has them escaping into the mountains, Arthur helps to find supplies and later tracks down fellow gang member John Marston. He helps to rob a train owned by Leviticus Cornwall and, after moving to Horseshoe Overlook, fights against Cornwall's hired guns. Leaving for Clemens Point, Arthur becomes involved in a conflict between two warring families, the Braithwaites and the Grays, leading to the capture of John's son, Jack. Arthur retrieves Jack from the supervision of crime lord Angelo Bronte, and helps retaliate against Bronte after he ushered them into a trap. Arthur notices Dutch's violent outburst as uncharacteristic of him. In Saint Denis, a failed bank heist forces some members of the group out of town; Arthur is shipwrecked with others on Guarma, an island near Cuba, but battle alongside a revolutionary in exchange for a ship back to the mainland. Reuniting with the rest, Arthur resolves to save the now captured John, much to the disdain of Dutch. Arthur is then diagnosed with tuberculosis. Shocked by the grim reality of his imminent death, he starts reflecting on decisions and morals, led further by his friendship with Native American leader Rains Fall. This drives his desire to protect the remnants of the gang, particularly John and his family. Upon saving John, Arthur reveals his doubts about Dutch, unable to accept his leader's growing obsession.</p>
